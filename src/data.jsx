    aboutProject:
      "I have developed a Loan Application with a seamless and automated process using the MERN stack to simplify loan requests and approvals.The application starts with a landing page featuring a loan calculator, allowing users to estimate their loan details. Upon proceeding, the system collects the user's email and CNIC number. Once submitted, the user receives an email containing their CNIC and a system-generated password as their login credentials. The email also includes a dashboard access link, where the user is required to change their password upon first login for security purposes.Inside the user dashboard, the applicant must add two guarantors to complete their loan request. Once submitted, the admin reviews and approves the request, after which the user is granted the loan.This system ensures a secure, structured, and efficient loan processing workflow, making it easy for both applicants and administrators to manage loans. 💰✅",
